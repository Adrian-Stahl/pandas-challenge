 Module 4 challenge 
An analysis has been completed to improve the school district's decision making process in relation to its budget and priorities. It is worth noting that while district schools have a larger budget than charter schools, the latter are obtaining better passing rates. This could be due to the overcrowding in district schools, as these have more students than charter schools. The data seems to show that teachers provide a better quality in education when they have more time to attend each student individually. 

Nonetheless, even though district schools have more students, both school types help students maintain steady grades throughout their high school career.
